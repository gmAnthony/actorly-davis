          I'm the software engineer that created this fine website. A few years
          ago my wife told me she had a million dollar idea for a website and,
          while maybe not capable of generating a million dollars, this website
          was her great idea. My hope is that if you don't find it useful you at
          least find it amusing. I built this site using React, TypeScript, and
          Mantine.
        </p>
        <p>Here are my development plans for this site:</p>
        <ul style={{ listStyle: "none" }}>
          <li>
            <Badge color="blue">Current</Badge> Fix some wonkiness with the
            network chart
          </li>
          <li>
            <Badge color="yellow">Planned</Badge> Make the site mobile-friendly
          </li>
          <li>
            <Badge color="yellow">Planned</Badge> Add an alternate view which
            just lists the shared movies/films
          </li>
          <li>
            <Badge color="yellow">Planned</Badge> Add the ability to only show
            movies or shows instead of both
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
